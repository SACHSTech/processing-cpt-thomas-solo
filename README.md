<h2>Gameplay Mechanics:</h2>

This game only makes use the WAD keys, as well as the space bar which functions as an alternative to W. Holding A or D will move the player left or right respectively, and pressing W or the space bar when on the ground will allow the player to jump. The player must jump from platform to platform in order to reach the goal at the end of each level. The player get three lives per run, and losing all three lives will reset them back to the first level. Platforms can be jumped onto from below, but cannot be dropped down from.

The game does not feature any wall collision, as the way the levels are designed do not necessitate such collision detection.
